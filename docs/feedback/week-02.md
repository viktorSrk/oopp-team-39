#### Meeting Organization

pass, There was a chairman and minute taker.

#### Agenda

Feedback: Sufficient, The template of the agenda was followed and delivered 1 day before. For next time keep delivering it 1-2 days before the meeting but add a time indication. Also add whether the agenda item is to Inform/ brainstorm/ decision making/ discuss.

#### Chair performance

Feedback: Good, all topics in the agenda were covered. The chairman made sure that he could move on before going to the next agenda item. Make sure to move on/leave enough time to wrap up your meeting.

#### Time management

Feedback: Good, The agenda items were all covered and were not rushed inorder to fit withing the time frame. Make sure the agenda has a time indication and move on when there is not enough time.

#### Minute taker performance

Feedback: Excelent, for each topic there is a short summary describing what has been agreed upon and what has been said by the TA. A member that would not have been able to attend this meeting would be able to read up on the topics through the notes.

#### Relation

Feedback: Good, healthy conversations were held but at times the chairman was mostly talking/suggesting. Ofcourse the chairman will talk a bit more but keep this in mind for next time.
