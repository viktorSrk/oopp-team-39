### Backlog

### Submission

Feedback: Pass, There is only one file in PDF format.

### Backlog Structure

Feedback: Pass, All the main elements are present and have been covered thoroughly. It even includes mockups.

### Epics

Feedback: Insufficient, the epics are missing right now. Make sure the epics are complete, prioritized from top to bottom and that they are consistent with the lecture. Each of the epic need to have their feature described and you could use your mockups to complement the description. Overal just make sure to read the assignment for this carefully.


### User Stories

Feedback: sufficient, The user stories don't seem to contradict eachother or overlap. And the user stories have a clear focus on the user perspective. But make sure to keep following the format (as *role*, want to *requirement* so I can *reason*). The , "so I can", part can be used to clarify your intentions and why the user story is nessecary. Also user stories should generally describe one particular interaction/workflow. To take as an example the "additional information" requirement. Just split it up and say I want to be able to add a description/subtasks so I can *reason*. Now you have two short requirements for which the description is clearer and more straight to the point. One last note when adding epics make sure that the user stories cover the description and that the user stories are grouped by epic! 


### Acceptance Criteria

Feedback: Sufficient, Most user stories are small and have a clear description, so their acceptance criteria are implicit. But others are relatively big and overloaded. Like the "additional information" requirement I mentioned or the requirement for being able to tag certain cards. Just keep it small and don't create a subpoint, just create another requirement. This way user stories are measurable/observable, so you can decide wheter or not they are finished. If user stories tend to just be overloaded add acceptance criteria's to disambiguate them. This could be the case for the keyboard shortcuts.
