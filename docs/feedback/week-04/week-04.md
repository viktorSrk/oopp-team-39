# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Marco Smidt
Minute taker: George Rusu

Feedback: Pass, There was a Chair and minute taker.

#### Agenda 

Feedback: Excellent, the Agenda follows the template, has time indicators and was uploaded before the meeting.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Feedback: Very Good, there are a couple lines of text shortly explaining what has been said/agreed upon for each agenda item. They also clearly state what should be done for the coming week.

Also nice that there is a link included and examples/short tutorial.

#### Chair performance

Feedback: Sufficient, Make sure to have enough time for all the agenda items. In this case one item was not very important but can definitly be an issue when this is not the case.

Make sure to move on in time so all topcis are covered.

#### Attitude & Relation

Feedback: Very Good/Excellent, Healthy discussions were being held. Everyone was listened to and there was overal a constructive athmosphere. 

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Feedback: Insufficient, Really make showing me your product a priority. I suggest really making this an agenda item so that there is time reserved for it.

Make sure to merge everything in main and then during the meeting show me the main branch.
