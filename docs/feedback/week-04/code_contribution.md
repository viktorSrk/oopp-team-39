# Code Contributions and Code Reviews

#### Focused Commits

Feedback: Excellent, the commits are small and concise oneliners that summarize the changes to the system. Good job.

#### Isolation

Feedback: Excellent, branches are used to implement features.

#### Reviewability
Feedback: Excellent, MR's have a clear focus that becomes clear from the title and the description.

Mr's cover a small amount of commits and the deviation to main is small.

Nothing much to say hear good job.


#### Code Reviews

Feedback: Very Good, MRs contain Back and forth discussions that are constructive and lead to code improvements.

MR [!16](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-39/-/merge_requests/16) is a great example of this. Confirming that you have implemented the given feedback is great.

One thing, try to always leave a comment behind even when everything is perfect, in MR [!26](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-39/-/merge_requests/26) say something like "Looks good, ctrl has been created and added to mainCtrl aswell". Just a short comment showing you have gone over the code/tested it.

#### Build Server

Feedback: Very good, all branches pass and don't take too long.

Builds do often fail due to checkstyle/tests. Remember run your builds before committing/merging.

Also try to fix your builds as soon as possible even if it is not on main, this [build](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-39/-/pipelines/819228) took some time to be fixed.
