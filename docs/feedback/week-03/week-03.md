# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: George Rusu
Minute taker: Senne Drent

Feedback: Pass, There was a Chair and Note taker.

#### Agenda 

Feedback: Very Good, The agenda follows the template. It has a time indication and the individual points were clear so the team knew what to expect/prepare. Make sure to upload the agenda to gitlab before the meeting. And clear indication whether the agenda item is to Inform/ brainstorm/ decision making/ discuss.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Feedback: The minute Taker from previous week can take a look at the week-02 feedback. From now on I wil give feedback on the previous note Taker.

#### Chair performance

Feedback: Good, All the agenda items were covered and have been given good amount of time. Make sure to be a bit more in the lead. It's fine if you move on early or if the meeting ends early but wrap up the meeting and as chair it's your job to move on.


#### Attitude & Relation

Feedback: Very Good, Team took ownership of the meeting. Everyones ideas were taken into account and everyone was listened to. Everyone added atleast something to the meeting. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Feedback: Insufficient, From this week on since you will be starting to code. Show me your current state of the application. This could be an agenda item. Show me what has changed and make sure these changes are in main. What I want to see is a shippable product product, meaning what has been merged has to run.
