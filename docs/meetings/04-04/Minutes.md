## Three Deadlines (next tuesday instead of friday due to easter)
- Product Pitch
- Heuristic Usability Evaluation
- Final Code Submission

## Feedback
- We received positive feedback on the technology rubric
    - missing long pulling but fixed it already, only focus on that
- Heuristic Usability Evalutaion is a pass
    - **TODO: link it to the mock-ups (check whatsapp) / add imagery**
    - We should include changes we did in the evaluation (ideally from the actual app and not mockups, unless no other option)
- We failed the product because not all basic requirements (drag and drop) were implemented yet
    - Marco will finishe it soon
- Distribution of Code Contribution looks good

## Grading of advanced features
- Depending on TA, wrong prioritization (card details before multi board) might negatively effect the grade
- **Senne will implement most basic multi-board within the next days**
- If multi-board is not implemented, we should skip the board selection frame

## Status of Final Product
- product is almost finished
- we don't have to submit anything, the repository closes
- there is a small bug with adding lists, two lists appear instead of one (the backend works)

## Prodcut Pitch
- **Shoot the video's at home until *Monday***
- **Meet on Discord on *Saturday* morning to discuss the script**

## Heuristic Usability Evalutaion
- Everyone look into the feedback and change according to it, if you have time
- Prioritize the Prodcut Pitch and the Product though
